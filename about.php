		<h3>Richard Söderberg</h3>
		<p>Richard Söderberg’s primary focus on photography 
		lies within the synergy between the human body, 
		clothing and the perspective/angle from which 
		it is viewed. His deep understanding of garments 
		and their existence is rooted in his background 
		as fashion designer of underground label Obscur. 
		The eye for details in the materials and skin creates 
		a unique image using different ideas on how to present 
		them through analog photography.</p>
